    Questions asked

    Why do we use a constructor in this program?

     The constructor is used to initialize the DoctorID and YearsOfExperience properties at the time of object creation. This ensures the object starts with meaningful values and reduces the need for manual initialization later.

    What does const Doctor& other mean in the functions?

     It means that the function takes a reference to another Doctor object as an argument. The const ensures the function doesnâ€™t modify the other object, and using a reference avoids making a copy of the object, improving performance.

    What is the purpose of the LessThanEquals function?

     It compares the YearsOfExperience of the current Doctor object (this) with another Doctor object passed as an argument (other) and checks if the current doctor has less than or equal experience.
     What will happen if you remove the const keyword from the function parameter?

    Expected Answer: Without const, the function could accidentally modify the other object passed as an argument. It would also disallow passing const objects to the function, limiting its usability.

    Can you explain the difference between d1.Equals(d2) and d1.NotEquals(d2)?

    Expected Answer: d1.Equals(d2) returns true if d1.YearsOfExperience is equal to d2.YearsOfExperience, while d1.NotEquals(d2) returns true if they are not equal.

    Why did we use #include <string> in this program?

    Expected Answer: The string class is part of the Standard Template Library (STL), and #include <string> provides access to it. This allows us to use std::string to store text data like DoctorID.
