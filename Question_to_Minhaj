1.You are tasked with designing a simple "calculator" program using only a switch-case statement and 
  relational/logical operators. The program should take two integers and a single character operator (+, -, *, /)
  as input. However, it must also handle an error condition where division by zero is attempted, 
  and it should display an appropriate error message in that case. Write the program.
2.You have a table named Orders with the following structure:

                |OrderID	| CustomerID |	OrderDate	| TotalAmount|

    Write a SQL query to find the CustomerID that has placed exactly 3 orders with a total amount greater 
    than 500 each. Ensure the solution uses aggregate functions and a subquery.
3.You have a directory named /projects that contains several files and subdirectories. 
  Manually set the following permissions for the directory and all its contents:

    Owner: Read, write, and execute permissions.
    Group: Read and execute permissions.
    Others: Read-only permissions.

  How would you achieve this using Linux commands for a single file and a directory
4.    class Base {
      public:
          virtual void display() { cout << "Base Display" << endl; }
      };
      
      class Derived : public Base {
      public:
          void display() override { cout << "Derived Display" << endl; }
      };
      
      int main() {
          Base *b = new Derived();
          b->display();
      }

    What will be the output of the above program and why?
