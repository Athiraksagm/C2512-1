### **Use of `virtual` in C++**

In C++, the `virtual` keyword is used to enable **runtime polymorphism** and to override methods in derived classes. It is primarily associated with inheritance and is applied to functions declared in a base class. By making a function `virtual`, you allow derived classes to provide their own version of the function, which can be invoked dynamically at runtime through a base class pointer or reference.

---

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Dynamic Dispatch**:
   - When a `virtual` function is called using a base class pointer or reference pointing to a derived class object, the derived class's version of the function is invoked (if overridden). This is known as **runtime polymorphism**.

2. **Overriding**:
   - A derived class can provide its specific implementation of a `virtual` function, overriding the base class's implementation.

3. **Virtual Table (V-Table)**:
   - C++ uses a mechanism called the **virtual table** (v-table) to resolve function calls dynamically. Each class with virtual functions has a v-table containing pointers to the functions.

4. **Avoid Code Duplication**:
   - Virtual functions ensure that the most specific version of a function is executed without requiring manual checks for the object's type.

### **Example: Virtual Functions for Dynamic Polymorphism**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Shape {
public:
    // Virtual function to calculate area
    virtual void calculateArea() {
        cout << "Base Shape: No specific area calculation." << endl;
    }

    // Virtual destructor
    virtual ~Shape() {
        cout << "Base Shape destructor called." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class for Circle
class Circle : public Shape {
private:
    double radius;

public:
    // Constructor
    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}

    // Override calculateArea
    void calculateArea() override {
        cout << "Circle Area: " << 3.14 * radius * radius << endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~Circle() {
        cout << "Circle destructor called." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class for Rectangle
class Rectangle : public Shape {
private:
    double length, width;

public:
    // Constructor
    Rectangle(double l, double w) : length(l), width(w) {}

    // Override calculateArea
    void calculateArea() override {
        cout << "Rectangle Area: " << length * width << endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~Rectangle() {
        cout << "Rectangle destructor called." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create objects of derived classes
    Shape* shape1 = new Circle(5.0);
    Shape* shape2 = new Rectangle(4.0, 6.0);

    // Call calculateArea using base class pointer
    cout << "Dynamic Polymorphism:" << endl;
    shape1->calculateArea();  // Calls Circle's calculateArea
    shape2->calculateArea();  // Calls Rectangle's calculateArea

    // Clean up
    delete shape1;  // Proper cleanup ensured due to virtual destructor
    delete shape2;

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
Dynamic Polymorphism:
Circle Area: 78.5
Rectangle Area: 24
Circle destructor called.
Base Shape destructor called.
Rectangle destructor called.
Base Shape destructor called.
```

### **Explanation**

1. **Virtual Function Usage**:
   - The `calculateArea` function in the base class `Shape` is declared `virtual`.
   - Both `Circle` and `Rectangle` override the `calculateArea` function with their specific implementations.

2. **Base Class Pointer**:
   - The base class pointer (`Shape*`) is used to point to derived class objects.
   - When `shape1->calculateArea()` is called, it dynamically determines the appropriate function to invoke (`Circle::calculateArea`).

3. **Virtual Destructor**:
   - The base class `Shape` has a `virtual` destructor, ensuring proper cleanup of derived class objects.

---

### **Why Use `virtual`?**

1. **Dynamic Binding**:
   - Without the `virtual` keyword, C++ uses **static binding**, and the base class version of the function is invoked regardless of the object's actual type.

2. **Extensibility**:
   - Virtual functions allow for future extensions without modifying the base class.

3. **Polymorphic Behavior**:
   - Enables behavior where derived classes can modify functionality dynamically at runtime.

---

### **Example Without `virtual`**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Shape {
public:
    void calculateArea() {
        cout << "Base Shape: No specific area calculation." << endl;
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void calculateArea() {
        cout << "Circle Area: Overridden method." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* shape = new Circle();
    shape->calculateArea();  // Calls Shape's version due to static binding

    delete shape;
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
Base Shape: No specific area calculation.
```

- The base class function is called because static binding does not allow overriding behavior at runtime.

### **Virtual with Pure Virtual Functions**

A **pure virtual function** is a function declared in the base class with `= 0`, making the class **abstract**. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.

**Example**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Abstract class
class Shape {
public:
    // Pure virtual function
    virtual void calculateArea() = 0;

    // Virtual destructor
    virtual ~Shape() {}
};

class Circle : public Shape {
private:
    double radius;

public:
    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}
    void calculateArea() override {
        cout << "Circle Area: " << 3.14 * radius * radius << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Shape shape; // Error: Cannot instantiate abstract class
    Shape* shape = new Circle(5.0);
    shape->calculateArea();  // Calls Circle's calculateArea

    delete shape;
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
Circle Area: 78.5
```

### **Best Practices**

1. **Use Virtual Functions When Needed**:
   - Apply `virtual` to functions expected to be overridden in derived classes.

2. **Always Provide a Virtual Destructor**:
   - Ensures proper cleanup of derived class resources.

3. **Avoid Overuse**:
   - Using virtual functions unnecessarily can increase memory usage due to v-table creation.

4. **Mark Functions with `override`**:
   - Clearly indicate that a function is intended to override a base class function. This avoids mistakes when signatures do not match.

5. **Use Pure Virtual Functions for Interfaces**:
   - Use pure virtual functions to define a clear contract for derived classes.
