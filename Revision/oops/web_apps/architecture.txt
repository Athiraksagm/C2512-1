### **Introduction to Web Applications**

Web applications are programs that run on a web server and can be accessed through a web browser. Unlike traditional desktop applications, web applications are platform-independent and rely on the internet for accessibility.

### **Learning Outcomes**

1. **Client and Server Architecture**:
   - Understand how the client-server model works, where clients request services, and servers respond with the requested data.

2. **Tiers of Web Applications**:
   - Explore the various tiers in a web application, such as presentation, business logic, and data tiers, and the technologies associated with each.

### **Topics**

#### **1. Client-Server Architecture**

- **Definition**: A distributed application structure that divides tasks between the **client** (front end) and the **server** (back end).
- **How it works**:
  - The **client** (e.g., browser) sends a request to the **server** over the internet.
  - The **server** processes the request, fetches the required data, and sends a response back to the client.
  
**Example**: When you access a website:
  - **Client**: Browser (Google Chrome, Firefox).
  - **Server**: Hosts the website, processes the request, and returns data (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

---

#### **2. Web Applications**

- **Definition**: Software applications that use web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to provide services via the internet or an intranet.
- **Types**:
  - **Static Web Applications**: Deliver fixed content.
  - **Dynamic Web Applications**: Use server-side scripting (e.g., PHP, Node.js) to generate content dynamically based on user input.

---

#### **3. Flow of Control in a Web Application**

1. **User Action**: The user interacts with the web application via the browser.
2. **Request**: A request is sent to the server (HTTP/HTTPS).
3. **Processing**:
   - The server processes the request using business logic.
   - Fetches or updates data in the database if needed.
4. **Response**: The server sends the appropriate response (HTML, JSON, etc.) back to the browser.
5. **Rendering**: The browser renders the response for the user to view.

#### **4. Browser as a Thin Client and Web Server**

- **Thin Client**: 
  - A lightweight interface that relies on the server for processing.
  - Only handles the presentation layer.
  - **Example**: Web browsers.
  
- **Web Server**:
  - Handles HTTP requests, serves static files, and communicates with application servers.
  - **Examples**: Apache, NGINX.

---

#### **5. Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**:
  - Structure and content of a webpage.
  - **Example**: `<h1>Hello, World!</h1>`

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**:
  - Styling and layout of a webpage.
  - **Example**: `h1 { color: blue; }`

- **JavaScript**:
  - Adds interactivity and functionality.
  - **Example**: `document.querySelector('h1').textContent = 'Hello, JavaScript!';`

#### **6. Benefits of Web Applications**

1. **Cross-Platform**: Accessible from any device with a browser.
2. **No Installation**: Runs directly from the web.
3. **Automatic Updates**: Always up-to-date without manual intervention.
4. **Scalability**: Easy to scale and deploy changes.

---

#### **7. Static Pages and Dynamic Pages**

- **Static Pages**:
  - Content does not change unless manually updated.
  - Technologies: HTML, CSS.
  - **Example**: Personal blogs.

- **Dynamic Pages**:
  - Content changes based on user interaction or server-side logic.
  - Technologies: PHP, Node.js, Python.
  - **Example**: Social media profiles.

---

#### **8. Application Servers**

- **Definition**:
  - Middleware that handles business logic, database interactions, and integrations.
- **Examples**:
  - Tomcat, WebLogic, WildFly.
- **Role**: Bridges the gap between the web server and database.

---

#### **9. N-Tier Architecture**

- **Definition**: A software architecture that separates the application into multiple 
    logical layers or tiers.
- **Common Tiers**:
  1. **Presentation Tier**: User interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
  2. **Business Logic Tier**: Processes user input and rules (Java, Python).
  3. **Data Tier**: Stores and retrieves data (SQL, MongoDB).
  
**Benefits**:
  - Scalability.
  - Ease of maintenance.
  - Improved security.

#### **10. Difference Between Web Server and Application Server**

| **Aspect**           | **Web Server**                      | **Application Server**               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**           | Handles HTTP requests and static files. | Runs business logic and connects with databases. |
| **Technologies**      | Apache, NGINX                      | Tomcat, WebLogic, WildFly             |
| **Output**            | HTML, CSS, JavaScript              | Processed data or API responses       |
| **Scope**             | Presentation layer only            | Presentation and business layers      |

### **Conclusion**

Web applications are at the heart of modern software development, leveraging 
the client-server model, various technologies, and multi-tiered architectures. 
Understanding the flow of control, static vs dynamic pages, and the roles of web 
servers and application servers is essential for developing scalable and 
efficient web applications.
