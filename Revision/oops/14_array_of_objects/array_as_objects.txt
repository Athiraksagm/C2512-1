### **Array of Objects in a Class**

In C++, an **array of objects** refers to a collection of objects of the same class. These objects are stored in contiguous memory locations, just like elements of a regular array. Using an array of objects in a class allows you to manage multiple instances of the class within a single class definition.

---

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Array as a Class Member**:
   - An array of objects can be a member of a class, allowing the class to store and manage multiple instances of another class or itself.
   
2. **Encapsulation**:
   - Using a class array as a private member helps enforce encapsulation, and access is controlled through public member functions.

3. **Dynamic Array of Objects**:
   - A dynamic array of objects can be created using pointers and dynamic memory allocation (`new` and `delete`).

### **Example 1: Static Array of Objects as a Class Member**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Define a simple class for Students
class Student {
private:
    string name;
    int marks;

public:
    // Constructor
    Student(string n = "", int m = 0) : name(n), marks(m) {}

    // Function to set details
    void setDetails(string n, int m) {
        name = n;
        marks = m;
    }

    // Function to display details
    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Marks: " << marks << endl;
    }
};

// Class containing an array of Student objects
class Classroom {
private:
    Student students[5];  // Array of Student objects

public:
    // Function to initialize students
    void setStudentDetails(int index, string name, int marks) {
        if (index >= 0 && index < 5) {
            students[index].setDetails(name, marks);
        } else {
            cout << "Index out of bounds!" << endl;
        }
    }

    // Function to display all students
    void displayStudents() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            cout << "Student " << i + 1 << ": ";
            students[i].display();
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Classroom classroom;

    // Set details for students
    classroom.setStudentDetails(0, "Alice", 90);
    classroom.setStudentDetails(1, "Bob", 85);
    classroom.setStudentDetails(2, "Charlie", 95);
    classroom.setStudentDetails(3, "David", 80);
    classroom.setStudentDetails(4, "Eve", 88);

    // Display all students
    cout << "Classroom Students:" << endl;
    classroom.displayStudents();

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
Classroom Students:
Student 1: Name: Alice, Marks: 90
Student 2: Name: Bob, Marks: 85
Student 3: Name: Charlie, Marks: 95
Student 4: Name: David, Marks: 80
Student 5: Name: Eve, Marks: 88
```

#### **Explanation**:
- The `Classroom` class contains an array of `Student` objects (`students[5]`).
- The `setStudentDetails` method initializes each `Student` object in the array.
- The `displayStudents` method iterates through the array and calls each `Student` object's `display` function.

### **Example 2: Dynamic Array of Objects**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Define a simple class
class Employee {
private:
    string name;
    int id;

public:
    // Constructor
    Employee(string n = "", int i = 0) : name(n), id(i) {}

    // Function to set details
    void setDetails(string n, int i) {
        name = n;
        id = i;
    }

    // Function to display details
    void display() {
        cout << "ID: " << id << ", Name: " << name << endl;
    }
};

// Class managing a dynamic array of Employee objects
class Company {
private:
    Employee* employees;  // Pointer to array of Employee objects
    int size;

public:
    // Constructor
    Company(int s) : size(s) {
        employees = new Employee[size];  // Allocate memory for employees
    }

    // Destructor
    ~Company() {
        delete[] employees;  // Free dynamically allocated memory
        cout << "Memory deallocated!" << endl;
    }

    // Function to set employee details
    void setEmployeeDetails(int index, string name, int id) {
        if (index >= 0 && index < size) {
            employees[index].setDetails(name, id);
        } else {
            cout << "Index out of bounds!" << endl;
        }
    }

    // Function to display all employees
    void displayEmployees() {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            cout << "Employee " << i + 1 << ": ";
            employees[i].display();
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    int numEmployees = 3;
    Company company(numEmployees);  // Create a Company with 3 employees

    // Set employee details
    company.setEmployeeDetails(0, "John", 101);
    company.setEmployeeDetails(1, "Jane", 102);
    company.setEmployeeDetails(2, "Smith", 103);

    // Display all employees
    cout << "Company Employees:" << endl;
    company.displayEmployees();

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
Company Employees:
Employee 1: ID: 101, Name: John
Employee 2: ID: 102, Name: Jane
Employee 3: ID: 103, Name: Smith
Memory deallocated!
```

#### **Explanation**:
- The `Company` class dynamically allocates memory for an array of `Employee` objects using the `new` operator.
- The `~Company` destructor ensures that the dynamically allocated memory is released.
- Dynamic arrays are useful when the size of the array is not known at compile time.

### **Use Cases of Array of Objects in Classes**
1. **Managing Collections**:
   - Useful for scenarios where you need to store and manage multiple instances of a class (e.g., students, employees, products).
   
2. **Encapsulation**:
   - Arrays can be hidden as private members, and access is controlled through public member functions.
   
3. **Dynamic Data Management**:
   - Dynamic arrays allow flexibility for managing collections of objects when the size is determined at runtime.

4. **Reusable Components**:
   - Array of objects within a class enables modular and reusable design for components like inventories, lists, or records.

---

### **Key Points to Remember**
1. **Static vs Dynamic Arrays**:
   - Static arrays have a fixed size defined at compile time.
   - Dynamic arrays allow for variable sizes and use dynamic memory allocation.
   
2. **Memory Management**:
   - For dynamic arrays, always release allocated memory using `delete[]` in the destructor to prevent memory leaks.
   
3. **Encapsulation**:
   - Access to array elements should be controlled through member functions to ensure data integrity.

4. **Boundary Checking**:
   - Always validate indices when accessing array elements to avoid out-of-bounds errors.
