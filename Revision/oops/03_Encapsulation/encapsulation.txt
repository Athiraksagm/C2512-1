### **Encapsulation in C++**

**Encapsulation** is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It refers to the bundling of data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object’s components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse of the methods and data.

#### **Key Concepts of Encapsulation**
1. **Data Hiding**: Only necessary details are exposed through access specifiers, and the rest are hidden.
2. **Access Modifiers**: Control the visibility of class members:
   - **Private**: Members cannot be accessed outside the class.
   - **Public**: Members can be accessed from anywhere.
   - **Protected**: Members can be accessed within the class and its derived classes.
3. **Getter and Setter Methods**: Provide controlled access to private members.

### **Why Use Encapsulation?**
- **Improves Maintainability**: Changes in one part of the class do not affect the rest of the program.
- **Enhances Security**: Restricts unauthorized access to the internal details of a class.
- **Encourages Modularity**: Each class operates as an independent module.

### **Syntax and Example**

#### **Basic Example of Encapsulation**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Employee {
private:
    string name;  // Private variable to hold employee's name
    int age;      // Private variable to hold employee's age

public:
    // Setter for name
    void setName(string empName) {
        name = empName;
    }

    // Getter for name
    string getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter for age
    void setAge(int empAge) {
        if (empAge > 0) {  // Simple validation
            age = empAge;
        } else {
            cout << "Invalid age!" << endl;
        }
    }

    // Getter for age
    int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Function to display details
    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Employee emp;

    // Setting values using setters
    emp.setName("John Doe");
    emp.setAge(30);

    // Accessing values using getters
    cout << "Employee Details:" << endl;
    cout << "Name: " << emp.getName() << ", Age: " << emp.getAge() << endl;

    // Display using a method
    emp.display();

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Key Points in the Example**
1. **Private Members**: `name` and `age` are private and cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
2. **Public Getters and Setters**: Controlled access is provided through `setName`, `getName`, `setAge`, and `getAge`.
3. **Encapsulation in Action**: The data is safe from unintended interference, such as invalid age values being assigned.

---

### **Advantages of Encapsulation**
1. **Controlled Access**: Users can access data only through methods defined by the class.
2. **Data Validation**: Setter methods can include logic to validate data before setting it.
3. **Easier Debugging**: The scope of debugging is limited to the class where the issue occurs.
4. **Reusability**: Encapsulated classes can be reused in other programs without changes.

### **Common Interview Questions**
1. **What is Encapsulation in C++?**
   Encapsulation is the process of combining data members and member functions into a single unit and controlling access to them using access specifiers.

2. **How is Encapsulation achieved in C++?**
   Encapsulation is achieved through the use of classes and access specifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public`. Private members are accessed using public getter and setter functions.

3. **How does encapsulation differ from abstraction?**
   - **Encapsulation** focuses on restricting access to data and methods for security and control.
   - **Abstraction** focuses on hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features.

4. **What are access specifiers in C++?**
   - **Private**: Members are not accessible outside the class.
   - **Public**: Members are accessible from anywhere.
   - **Protected**: Members are accessible in derived classes.

### **Advanced Example with Validation and Default Constructor**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class BankAccount {
private:
    string accountHolder;
    double balance;

public:
    // Default constructor
    BankAccount() {
        accountHolder = "Unknown";
        balance = 0.0;
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    BankAccount(string name, double initialBalance) {
        accountHolder = name;
        balance = (initialBalance >= 0) ? initialBalance : 0.0;
    }

    // Setter for account holder
    void setAccountHolder(string name) {
        accountHolder = name;
    }

    // Getter for account holder
    string getAccountHolder() {
        return accountHolder;
    }

    // Getter for balance
    double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // Method to deposit money
    void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        } else {
            cout << "Invalid deposit amount!" << endl;
        }
    }

    // Method to withdraw money
    void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            cout << "Invalid withdrawal amount!" << endl;
        }
    }

    // Display account details
    void displayAccount() {
        cout << "Account Holder: " << accountHolder << ", Balance: $" << balance << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Using parameterized constructor
    BankAccount acc("Alice", 1000.0);
    acc.displayAccount();

    // Deposit and withdraw
    acc.deposit(500);
    acc.withdraw(200);
    acc.displayAccount();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, encapsulation is used to manage a bank account securely, ensuring that invalid deposits or withdrawals are prevented. It demonstrates real-world application and encapsulation’s utility.
